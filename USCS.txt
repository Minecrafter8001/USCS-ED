--------------Universal Ship Classification System--------------
REV: 1.6

Rules:
 - The ID must always start with the pad size.
 - Pad size and purpose must be separated with a dash (-).
 - Each ID cannot be longer than 6 characters (this includes every part, including the dash).
 - Numbers cannot be used due to the character limit. If you want to differentiate between ships with the same ID, do so with their name.

Format:
- "a" means a primary purpose; these can be used on any ship that serves said purpose.
- "a \ " means that this purpose falls under the last purpose, so TRD covers MIN and LAS, but MIN doesn't cover TRA.
- While you can use CMB on an anti-xeno ship, it's usually better to use AXO. The same goes for TRD on a core mining ship, but COR provides more information.

Pad Size:
 - MP: Medium pad (for ships that require medium-sized landing pads)
 - SP: Small pad (for ships that require small-sized landing pads)
 - LP: Large pad (for ships that require large-sized landing pads)

Purpose:
 - EXP: Explorer (for ships designed for exploration)
  \ GRD: Guardian (for ships designed for running guardian monuments, usually equipped with an SRV bay and point defense turrets)
  \ LRG: Long range (for ships with long jump ranges, usually equipped with an engineered FSD and/or a Guardian FSD booster)
 - TRD: Trade (for ships designed for trading)
  \ MIN: Miner (for ships designed for mining)
    \ LAS: Laser (for mining ships designed for laser mining, usually equipped with mining lasers)
    \ SUR: Surface (for mining ships designed for surface mining, usually equipped with abrasion lasers)
    \ SUB: SubSurface (for mining ships designed for subsurface mining, usually equipped with subsurface displacement missiles)
    \ COR: Deep-Core (for mining ships designed for core mining, usually equipped with seismic charge launchers and a pulse wave scanner)   
  \ TRA: Transporter (for ships designed for transporting, usually have weak or no shields with lots of cargo space)
 - CMB: Combat (for ships designed for combat)
  \ PVE: Player vs. Entity (for ships specialized in combating NPCs)
  \ PVP: Player vs. Player (for ships specialized in player combat)
  \ AXO: Anti-Xeno Operations (for ships designed for combating alien threats)
 - GEN: General-Purpose (for ships designed for versatile or undefined roles)
 - UTL: Utility (for ships designed for general-purpose utility or miscellaneous roles)
 - DEC: Decommissioned (for ships that are no longer in use and/or been stipped of all modules)
