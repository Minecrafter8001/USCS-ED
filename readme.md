# Universal Ship Classification System (USCS)

The Universal Ship Classification System (USCS) is my way of identifying a ship's purpose/use instantly and easily.

## Purpose

The main goal of the USCS is to allow ship purposes to be instantly identified without either looking at the modules or inferring it from the name.

Feel free to use and modify USCS as needed.
