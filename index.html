  <h1>Universal Ship Classification System</h1>
  <p><em>REV: 2.0</em></p>

  <h2>Rules:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The ID must always start with the pad size.</li>
    <li>Pad size and purpose must be separated with a dot.</li>
    <li>Each ID cannot be longer than 6 characters (this includes every part, including the dash).</li>
    <li>Numbers cannot be used due to the character limit. If you want to differentiate between ships with the same ID, do so with their name.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Format:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A dot means a primary purpose; these can be used on any ship that serves said purpose.</li>
    <li>An indented dot means that this purpose falls under the last purpose, so TRD covers MIN and LAS, but MIN doesn't cover TRA.</li>
    <li>An indented square means a sub-sub purpose, for example, the difference between a trading ship, a mining ship, and a core mining ship.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Pad Size:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>MP: Medium pad (for ships that require medium-sized landing pads)</li>
